# Quests

Quests are the key to acquiring better gear or even new abilities.

## Profession Quests
One of the most simple form of quests are the gather quests. A player will need
to use its profession to gather resources and deliver them. This is a great way
to gain experience in your experience and gather money or reputation. Most of
these quests will be repeatable. So players can go play a storyline quest,
gather resources along the way and deliver them when they return.  
I'm aware of the fact that this opens reputation farming through buying
resources and finishing such quests repeatedly. This is actually an interaction
we're happy to see.
