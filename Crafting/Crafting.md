# Crafting
Crafting is a big thing in Vortex. The main motivation for players is to gain
crafting materials. Which in its turn are used to create new equipment.

## Basics
Every player will train in at least one profession. As one of the unlucky to be 
sucked into the vortex, you'll have no problem joining the cause of rebuilding
a civilisation. Yet in order do so the players will need crafting materials 
which will be hard to come by.

The professions are:
 * Smith
   - Armour
   - Weapon
   - Utility
 * Constructor
   - Warmachine
   - Building (fortifications, guild housing)
   - Engineer
 * Alchemist
   - Potion
   - Material
   - Enchanting

## Schematics
A schematic is a set of written instructions on how to craft a certain item. 
After reading a schematic, somebody with the right profession is able to create
the item.
   
## Components
Every tool to be made will need a couple of components. A simple sword for 
example will need:
 * Iron, the base material
 * Leather, for the grip
 * Coal or wood, to burn in the forge
A schematic will only include the category of components required. Using 
different materials will result in different items. In the simple sword example
one could substitute the iron for steel creating a stronger sword. Experimenting
with different materials may create new and better results. It may also happen
that the schematic doesn't yield a usable item. This might happen when one tries
to create a sword made of gold.
   
## TODO
 * Durability (unbreakable)
 * Skill tree / Leveling
 * Location bound
 * Guilds?
