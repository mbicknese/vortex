# Combat Challenge

Every fight, from fighting a boar to killing the high warlord ultimate boss,
offers some form of challenge. Never will killing a mob be blasting plain
damage.

## Preset tactics

### Difficult to attack

Some monster are difficult to attack. Meaning they'll either try to disengage
from the fight or have other tricks to avoid being harmed. Most wildlife/sport
will try to run from the fight. It'll either need to be killed instantaneously
or be immobilized as soon as possible.

### Cover up

The cover up tactic is used by physically weak characters. They protect
themselves by distracting the players with other mobs or challenges. These
enemies need to be defeated by either ignoring the cover up and going straight
for the main guy. Or by disabling the cover up mechanism.

### Weak spot

A all time classic. The character is immune to most kind of damage. Except when
you hit it from a certain angle. A different sort of damage might also do the
trick.
