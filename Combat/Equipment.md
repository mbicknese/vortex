# Equipment

There are three equipment groups: Offense, Defense and Utility. Magic on items is
rare but mostly found on utility items. i.e. Utility items are idols, relics or 
other small wearables containing magical powers.

## Offense
Offensive items are mainly focussed on boasting attacks. Usually offensive items
are seen as weapons. Each weapon group has its own properties. The following weapon 
groups are known:
  ### Staffs
  Staffs can range from full utility item to full offensive item. In the first
  case it will be used by spellcasters and enable them to cast stronger spells.
  In the other case the strength of the wood is important seeing that the staff
  is going to get some blows. A combination is possible as well, think Gandalf
  fighting with both staff and sword.  
  Examples: Broomstick, Spade, Wizards staff, Bo.
  
  A staff would be a good starters item since farmers are quite able to get their
  hands on them.
  
   * Control: medium
   * Damage: medium
  
  ### Swords
  The elitist one-to-one melee weapon. Swords are expensive as they're hard to
  craft. They need to be sharp, balanced and sturdy. Compromising on one of these
  aspects would reduce the damage output.  
  Examples: Longsword, Katana, Rapier, Cutlass.
  
   * Control: high
   * Damage: medium
  
  ### Maces
  Blunt on a stick. Weight and balance are important for these weapons.  
  Examples: Blacksmith hammer, Hammer of justice, Mace, Morningstar.
  
  A more uncommon starter item but could be possible.
  
   * Control: low
   * Damage: high
  
  ### Axes
  * Polearms
  * Bows
  * Throw
  * Dagger
