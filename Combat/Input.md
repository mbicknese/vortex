# Input / Controls

## Concept 1

### Selecting targets
The TAB key will cycle forward through all enemies in a cone in front of the
player. Using the SHIFT modifier a player can cycle backwards instead. In
addition the CTRL modifier can be used to cycle through friendly targets, both
forwards and backwards (using SHIFT).

### Attack set
A players attack set can contain up to six abilities. These six are bound to the
middle and right mouse button. Using either SHIFT or CTRL the player can switch
between three sets of two attacks.

#### Left Mouse Button
The left mouse button is not bound to an attack since we want to keep it free
for other clickable input. We don't want a player to attack while trying to
focus a friendly player by clicking on it.

### Moving
WASD is the default for moving around. A and S will move you towards to or away
from your target respectively. W and D are used to strafe (not turn). One does
not strafe in a linear way but in an arch around its target. This is done to
preserve the aim at the target.
