# Combat

In Vortex combat works with a guided active system. Players need to position
themselves to both maintain line of sight and stay out of harms way. Melee
characters will be running around, jumping in for an attack and disengaging to
dodge incoming attacks. Even tanks will need to dodge most attacks. Cause big
ass endgame armour and piles of experience won't save you from a a giant club
to the head.

The guided system makes sure a character is always aiming at a chosen target. It
takes the movement of a character in consideration. This should make ranged
attacks hit on moving targets. The TAB key is the default for switching enemies.

Combat is and never should be plain damage. Every combat or monster has its own
special tricks and tactics. See [Combat Challenge][1]

## Classes

There are limited (4) classes in Vortex. But every class is able to specialise in
different roles. From a meta perspective we take the product of Martial and
Magic times Combat and Utility. This gives us the classes:

 * Warrior: Martial Combat
 * Ranger/Rogue: Martial Utility
 * Sorcerer: Magic Combat
 * Wizard: Magic Utility

 Each class is just as effective in combat. Though combat orientated classes
 will be full on action. Where utility classes are focused on crowd control,
 healing, slowly building to a massive blast.

 ### Roles / Subclasses

 Each class has its own set of soft subclasses. The reason they're soft is
 because a player has to build it themselves by choosing an ability subset.
 A couple of examples are:

  * The Sorcerer training in sword abilities becoming a spellsword. Using spells
  while being able to fight close combat.
  * Warriors can achieve a similar subclass by picking up spell abilities.
  Instead of being a spellsword, a warrior will be more of a paladin. The main
  class always sets the default fighting style.
  * Wizards can choose from a wide variety of spells. Each school will create a
  different subclass. Healing spells will create a cleric, demonic spells
  will lead to a warlock.

_Alternative:_ Have no classes at all and have players build their own with a
cool skill system.

## Abilities

Abilities are learned from various characters (masters) spread throughout the
world. The basic abilities necessary to create the class can be learned from any
master. In addition every master has his own unique skills to learn to a player.

After learning a basic ability it can only be strengthened by usage. Using an
ability will increase the experience gained in that specific skill. This
automatically levels the abilities of a players favoured attacks.
