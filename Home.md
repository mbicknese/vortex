# Vortex

Welcome to the Vortex wiki!

## Introduction
Vortex is a project to note down my thoughts for a next-gen MMORPG. Feel free to incorporate these ideas in your game as long as you reference this wiki as source. For more information about using this wiki see the license file.

After playing some MMORPGs I noticed some annoyances and brilliant designs while none of them feels like the ultimate game. Thus Vortex was born. The keywords for this game would be _logic_ and _consistency_. Both story/storyline and game mechanics should contribute to these keywords, e.g., rat mobs shouldn't drop full plate armour.

## (Unique) Selling Points
Not all of the mechanics implemented might be the unique. The combination of the different mechanics should be unique or refreshing.

### Combat
To keep this section clear I'll use World of Warcraft(WoW) and Wildstar as examples. WoW uses a very passive combat system, one selects a target and spams its characters abilities. Wildstar is the opposite and uses a very active combat system where targeting a unit doesn't affect the cast ability. Vortex uses a mix of both of these games. Positioning is crucial, aiming not so much. 

### Professions
Almost every MMORPG has professions or a crafting system. Usually though such a system is an extra layer upon the main game play. One can reach endgame content without crafting a single piece. Professions in Vortex are at the very core. Non humanoid mobs will never drop equipment, Humanoids might occasionally drop some common gear. In the default setting one will acquire gear through professions. To back this system mobs, dungeons and material specific raids will drop materials for the crafting system.

### Races, Classes and Factions
At the moment the concept is to have 3 factions compete. Every race can fight for any faction. In addition should every race have distinctive stats.

## Vortex vs vortex
In this design you'll find the word 'vortex' used in two different ways. Capitalised Vortex refers to the game itself. While vortex in lowercase refers to the vortex existing on __Planet B__.
