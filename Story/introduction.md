# Vortex, story
On __Planet A__ a mysterous vortex openend, changing the live for all its
inhabitants. About a third of the population was sucked into the vortex never to
be seen again. But they were not lost. While __Planet A__ was losing its
population, __Planet B__ was surprised with unexpected visitors.

## Concept 1
Some people were confused, others were enraged. But it didn't take long for the
first leaders to arise. These men set up the __Faction 1__. As the time passed
settlements grew into villages and villages into cities. Farming resources on
__Planet B__ asked its toll, the native creatures aren't very fond of their new
neighbours. Yet __Faction 1__ managed to farm enough to keep most of the
population alive.

__Faction 1__ wasn't a very strict ruler. Not that it was necassary since most
people were more concerned with staying alive than with politics. One trusted
another and worked together. For some of the survivors this just wasn't good
enough. Remembering their status and riches on __Planet A__ they craved what was
once their power. __Faction 2__ was born. Members of __Faction 2__ tried to gain
control of the Vortex but were greatly outnumbered. Not feeling save between the
leaders they betrayed they left the civilised area to start a nation of their
own.

### pro
 * Strong epic story
 * Room for many details
 * It provides space for 'hiding' characters

### con
 * Time it takes for this story complete might be to long. I'd rather see the
 player live such a story themselves.

## Concept 2
Right from the start there was conflict between the victims. Claims to power
were overthrown and survival was harsh. People from multiple nation, from which
some were hostile to each other, were stuck together.

A group calling themselves __Faction 1__ started to unite and create an
establishment at the vortex.
