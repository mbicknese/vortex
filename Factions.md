# Factions
There are three factions in Vortex. The main reason behind this is because it
supplies more dynamic than two factions. While still maintaining the amount of
choises to a minimum.

## In game differences
Being in a different faction won't give you any fighting or leveling advantage.
It is focused on cosmetic changes.

Factions will differ in starting zones. capitals and quest givers. It will also
determine who you fight against in PvP zones. And last but not least it will
change the look of crafted items.

## The factions

### __Faction 1__
The original faction. Members of this faction were the original settlers of
__Planet B__. Sticking true to their roots the factions capital is located at
the vortex. Every new character is part of this faction.

### __Faction 2__
This faction will have a touch of nobility. Being 'arised' above the other two
factions.

### __Faction 3__
Last but not least is the greedy faction. Harvesting every possible resource
they can.

## Non-Static Factions
One faction controls the incoming vortex. Every new player enters through this
vortex and is automatically part of the controlling faction. After some tutorial
levels the player will be able to chose to switch to another faction.

This is just one of the quests which will allow player to switch factions. An
other quest might be getting lost with two character (NPC) from a set faction.
After spending time with this character the player will get familiar with them.
After completing the quest the characters ask the player to come home with them.
